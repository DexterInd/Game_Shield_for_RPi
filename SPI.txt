**modded spi.c
	SPI CPOL = 0x02
	SPI_LSB_FIRST 0x08
	Together they form 0x0A, or mode 
	mode = 0x03;

Clock polarity is working and we were able to change that.

Now the issue is in the LSB.  We're sending it backwards to what the RPi needs.

	order = 0x00;
        ret = ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_LSB_FIRST, &order);
        if (ret == -1)
                pabort("SPI Write LSB failed");

        ret = ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_LSB_FIRST, &order);
        if (ret == -1)
                pabort("SPI WRite LSB Failed");
 Is sucesful, but if we change the value of order to anything but 0x00, we get a failure.  set bit
